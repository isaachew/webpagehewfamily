I love coding; I code Python and HTML. I even coded this webpage myself! One of my highlights is the AIMS orchestra camp, held at ISP.</p> <p>On Friday the 5th of May 2017, my mother dropped me at Garden International School at the Recital Hall, at 7:15 to meet Mr Koelma. The bus left at 7:45. I sat with Rock, my orchestra partner. When we reached ISP (International School @ Parkcity), we were led to the Multi Purpose Hall (MPH). There were children from other schools: Alice Smith, ISP, our school, and Nexus International School. Then we went up to the rooms one floor up for Sectionals, where we practiced by section. I was Violin 2, but allocated to Violin 1, which means that the some of the pieces said 'Grade 4/5'. We played Burung Kakak Tua and Pirates of the Caribbean (violin 3).</p> <p>As I went to the MPH, I felt proud because I was going to play in an orchestra! I put my case and bottle beside my chair for the rehearsal. After that, we played Short Ride in a Fast Machine and The Firebird (Violin 2). At lunch, I ate deep-fried fish.  I also ate that the next day. After that, we played the remaining ones: Overture (violin 2), In the Hall of the Mountain King (violin 2) and Highlights from Harry Potter (also Violin 2). Then I went home with my mummy. The concert was on Friday 6th of May 2017, my sister's birthday.</p> <p>Another of my favourite parts is Sunway Lagoon, a theme park in Malaysia. We went there at 27<sup>th</sup>June. We went into the Wave Pool, in the water park inside. Then we went to the Nickelodeon part to take a look. My mom went to a water place and I stayed outside it. Then my mum said 'Why not experience pressure?' and we stepped into a pool by the side. Subsequently, we went to a giant wave pool, where we jumped at the waves. The day was quite fun, we took some last photos before heading back home.</p><img src=\"/static/img/Isaac 3D GIF.gif\"><p>I made this 3D renderer in Tynker, a 2D app with code blocks.

I am so excited to write something here because I cannot wait to see it appear on my very own page that my <age date=\"22/10/2008\">9</age> year old son has designed.&nbsp;</p> <p>To start, let me introduce myself. I first became mummy in the memorable year of 2008, when Isaac was born. He was born really tiny. However he was strong and determined as a baby, and he managed to fight through and came home 3 months later. He brings so much joy to our lives, and I love learning about his new discoveries daily. He is passionate about coding, maths and making music. He also enjoys running with his daddy, and swimming and the beach and even skiing! </p> <p> Then, in 2013, I welcomed another beautiful bundle of joy - Allegra!! She is very cheeky, always ready for an ice-cream adventure, loves singing and makes us laugh all the time. She is <age date=\"6/5/2013\">4</age> years old.&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"I passed it!\" width=\"175\" height=\"205\" src=\"/static/img/isaacpassed.png\"> <p> This appeared on Isaac's school webpage and even on their FB page.

Allow me to introduce myself in my very own tab on the Internet. My name is Yin Keat, and I'm the father of the web designer of this webpage. I have always been interested in HTML and wanted to design my own webpage, but Isaac beat me to it. </p> <p> When I'm not at work, I like to play Clash of Clans with <lnk tab=\"0\">Isaac</lnk>. We even have our own clan! Feel free to contact us if you want to be part of a great clan! (Our clan name is \"The Top Clan\". ) I also like playing Clash Royale, Piano Tiles, badminton, rollerblading, cycling and flying drones. </p> <p> When I'm not at work or playing, I also enjoy wines and whiskeys and almost anything alcoholic. I also enjoy trying out good food and listening to good music. </p>&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"], "owners": ["Yin Keat"], "style": ["", "rgb(204, 238, 255)", "rgb(170, 170, 119)", "", "rgb(170, 170, 119)"]}, {"content": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t&nbsp;\n\t&nbsp;\n\t&nbsp;\n\t", "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"], "owners": ["Sample"], "style": ["", "orange", "green", "", "orange"]}], "fonts": ["Cookie", "Khula"], "comments": [{"comment": "Testing admin and account", "uid": "Isaac", "tab": 0, "time": "2018-03-31 07:24:32.946558 UTC This is an admin posting."}], "passwords": {"Isaac": ["fd2c1b2071df9fc4fddbe43eaeb6d0eb5a95e23fac32d8ad4fc036593d8bb41b", 1]}}
