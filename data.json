I love coding; I code Python and HTML. I even coded this webpage myself! One of my highlights is the AIMS orchestra camp, held at ISP.</p> <p>On Friday the 5th of May 2017, my mother dropped me at Garden International School at the Recital Hall, at 7:15 to meet Mr Koelma. The bus left at 7:45. I sat with Rock, my orchestra partner. When we reached ISP (International School @ Parkcity), we were led to the Multi Purpose Hall (MPH). There were children from other schools: Alice Smith, ISP, our school, and Nexus International School. Then we went up to the rooms one floor up for Sectionals, where we practiced by section. I was Violin 2, but allocated to Violin 1, which means that the some of the pieces said 'Grade 4/5'. We played Burung Kakak Tua and Pirates of the Caribbean (violin 3).</p> <p>As I went to the MPH, I felt proud because I was going to play in an orchestra! I put my case and bottle beside my chair for the rehearsal. After that, we played Short Ride in a Fast Machine and The Firebird (Violin 2). At lunch, I ate deep-fried fish.  I also ate that the next day. After that, we played the remaining ones: Overture (violin 2), In the Hall of the Mountain King (violin 2) and Highlights from Harry Potter (also Violin 2). Then I went home with my mummy. The concert was on Friday 6th of May 2017, my sister's birthday.</p> <p>Another of my favourite parts is Sunway Lagoon, a theme park in Malaysia. We went there at 27<sup>th</sup>June. We went into the Wave Pool, in the water park inside. Then we went to the Nickelodeon part to take a look. My mom went to a water place and I stayed outside it. Then my mum said 'Why not experience pressure?' and we stepped into a pool by the side. Subsequently, we went to a giant wave pool, where we jumped at the waves. The day was quite fun, we took some last photos before heading back home.</p><img src='/static/img/Isaac 3D GIF.gif'><p>I made this 3D renderer in Tynker, a 2D app with code blocks.

He is passionate about coding, maths and making music. He also enjoys running with his daddy, and swimming and the beach and even skiing! </p> <p> Then, in 2013, I welcomed another beautiful bundle of joy - Allegra!!
