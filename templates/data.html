					<p>&#34;Failure is so important. We speak about success
					all the time. It is the ability to resist failure or use
					failure that often leads to greater success. I&#x27;ve met
					people who don&#x27;t want to try for fear of failing.&#34; - J.K. Rowling.
					I like this quote because it represents that failure is learning.</p>

					<p>Hi, welcome to my page. I am so
					excited to write something here because
					I cannot wait to see it appear on my
					very own page that my <span id="ihbn">8</span> year old son has
					designed.</p>
					<p>To start, let me introduce myself.
					I first became mummy in the memorable
					year of 2008, when Isaac was born. He
					was born really tiny. However he was strong
					and determined as a baby, and
					he managed to fight through and came home
					3 months later. He brings so much joy to our lives,
					and I love learning about his new discoveries daily. 
					He is passionate about coding, maths and making music.
					He also enjoys running with his daddy, and swimming and the
					beach and even skiing! </p>
					
					<p> Then, in 2013, I welcomed
					another beautiful bundle of joy - 
					Allegra!! She is very cheeky, always
					ready for an ice-cream adventure, loves singing and makes
					us laugh all the time. She is 
					<span id = "allborn">0</span> years old.
					</p>

						This appeared on Isaac's school webpage
						and even on their FB page. He did the interview
						on Wednesday. We are very happy for Isaac because
						I remember him working VERY hard doing the weekly
						videos and Problem Sets, as well as trying to meet
						the deadlines. You can look at his tab <span class="lnk" onclick='flip(2)'>here.</span>
					</p>

				<div class='left'>
					<p>
						I passed a coding course from MIT. My <span class="lnk" onclick='flip(1)'>mom</span> told me to work <b>really</b>
						hard to make it, and I made it! Yay!

					<p>Hi,I am Isaac,and I am <span id="ihage">8</span> years,
					<span id="ihmons">6</span> months old because my birthdate was on 22<sup>nd</sup> October 2008. I love coding; I
					code Python and HTML. I even coded this webpage myself! One of my highlights is the AIMS orchestra camp, held at
					ISP.</p>
					<p>On Friday the 5th of May 2017, my mother dropped me at Garden International
					School at the Recital Hall, at 7:15 to meet Mr Koelma.
					The bus left at 7:45. I sat with Rock, my orchestra partner.
					When we reached ISP (International School @ Parkcity), 
					we were led to the Multi Purpose Hall (MPH). There were 
					children from other schools: Alice Smith, ISP, our school,
					and Nexus International School. Then we went up to the rooms
					one floor up for Sectionals, where we practiced by section.
					I was Violin 2, but allocated to Violin 1, which means that
					the some of the pieces said "Grade 4/5". We played Burung
					Kakak Tua and Pirates of the Caribbean (violin 3).</p>
					<p>As I went to the MPH, I felt proud because I was going to play in an
					orchestra! I put my case and bottle beside my chair for the rehearsal. After that, we played
					Short Ride in a Fast Machine and The Firebird (Violin 2). At lunch,
					I ate deep-fried fish.  I also ate that the next day.
					After that, we played the remaining ones: Overture (violin 2),
					In the Hall of the Mountain King (violin 2)
					and Highlights from Harry Potter (also Violin 2). Then I went home with my mummy.
					The concert was on Friday 6th of May 2017, my sister's birthday.</p>
					<p>Another of my favourite parts is Sunway Lagoon, a theme park in Malaysia. We went there at 27<sup>th</sup>June. We
					went into the Wave Pool, in the water park inside. Then we went to the Nickelodeon part to take a look.
					My mom went to a water place and I stayed outside it. Then my mum said "Why not experience pressure?" 
					and we stepped into a pool by the side. Subsequently, we went to a giant wave pool, where we jumped at the waves. 
					The day was quite fun, we took some last photos before heading back home.</p>

						Greetings! Allow me to introduce myself in my
						very own tab on the Internet. My name is Yin Keat,
						and I'm the father of the web designer of this
						webpage. I have always been interested in HTML and
						wanted to design my own webpage, but Isaac beat me
						to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I'm not at work, I like to play Clash of Clans
						with <span class="lnk" onclick="flip(2)">Isaac</span>. We even have our own clan! Feel free to contact us if you want to be
						part of a great clan! (Our clan name is "The Top Clan". ) I also like playing Clash Royale,
						Piano Tiles, badminton, rollerblading, cycling and flying
						drones.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I'm not at work or playing, I also enjoy wines
						and whiskeys and almost anything alcoholic. I also
						enjoy trying out good food and listening to good music.
